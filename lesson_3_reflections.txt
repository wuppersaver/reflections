When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people on one single project or wanting to share 
the work, github is a great platform to do this. Others can access the files
and make changes themselves and also it can get more attention, if itÂ´s 
worthy of it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Like the debate about automatic saving or manual saving in version control when 
pushing or pulling automatically the versions might not be finished or runable.
Therefore the same arguments for pro and con are valid. One can forget to push
or pull, but when doing it automatically one might also get to many unnecessary
or unreasonable commits.
